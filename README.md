# Python Starting from 0

This repo is to lkeep a track of my Python learning progress as I am just a beginner. Anyone also can use it for free and learn yourself!

The projects section has some basic projects so they aren't as complicated as one might assume. You can see my other repositories for more complex and fun projectsðŸ˜Š
